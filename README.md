# Hi, welcome to my GitHub!



## About me

- üî≠ I studied an MSci in Physics (specialising in astrophysics) at Imperial College London where I gained my Python skills
- ü§ì Since, I have learnt C++ and put my knowledge to the test by recreating my MSci Project in C++
- üëæ I have gone on to complete Udemy courses in both C# and C++
- ü§ñ I am currently working on Numerical Methods in Astrophysics projects to bolster my numerical method proficiency
- üßê I am interested in going into the academic world by studying for a PhD!



## Projects


### Numerical Methods in Astrophysics

A collection of Python projects, which tackle various astrophysical problems to showcase the uses of different numerical methods.

### MSci Project (in Python)

A group of Python scripts, which encapsulate different approximations made for modelling the formation of giant planets in protoplanetary discs.

### MSci Project (in C++)

A group of C++ and associated header scripts, which encapsulate different approximations made for modelling the formation of giant planets in protoplanetary discs. (This is an updated version of the MSci Project (in Python), so the plots are very similar and I have removed some unnecessary scripts and classes).

### Flappy Bird Recreation (in Unity)

I followed a YouTube tutorial to create this, my first game, using Unity. It is a take on / recreation of the infamous Flappy Bird game. I have added some extra components to it since completing the tutorial.
